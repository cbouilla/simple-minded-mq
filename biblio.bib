Meanwhile we have actually succeeded in making our discipline a science, and in a remarkably simple way: merely by deciding to call it “computer science.”},

The models permit the study of tradeoffs between chip area and computation time. We show that these tradeoffs can be derived from a single common complexity measure of a problem. We derive bounds on this measure for matrix multiplication under weak assumptions about the operations of addition and multiplication. The assumptions are such that the bounds can be applied directly to transitive closure and matrix inversion."

abstract="The number field sieve is an algorithm to factor integers of the form re − s for small positive r and |s|. The algorithm depends on arithmetic in an algebraic number field. We describe the algorithm, discuss several aspects of its implementation, and present some of the factorizations obtained. A heuristic run time analysis indicates that the number field sieve is asymptotically substantially faster than any other known factoring method, for the integers that it applies to. The number field sieve can be modified to handle arbitrary integers. This variant is slower, but asymptotically it is still expected to beat all older factoring methods.",
